# Stupid Coaching

An app where users can enter a message and their coach will answer to the message.

1. If the message is “I am going to work”, the coach will answer “Great!”
2. If the message has a question mark ? at the end, the coach will answer “Silly question, get dressed and go to work!”.
3. Otherwise the coach will answer “I don't care, get dressed and go to work!”
